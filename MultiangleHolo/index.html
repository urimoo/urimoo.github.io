    <meta name="description" content="Holography has immense potential for near-eye displays in the realms of virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), offering natural 3D depth cues through wavefront reconstruction. However, a critical challenge is balancing the field of view (FOV) with the eyebox, fundamentally constrained by the étendue limitation of current hardware. Additionally, holographic image quality is often compromised due to discrepancies between actual wave propagation behavior and simulation models. This study addresses these challenges by expanding the eyebox through the use of multi-angle illumination, and by enhancing image quality with end-to-end pupil-aware hologram optimization. Further, energy efficiency is significantly improved by incorporating higher-order diffractions and pupil constraints into the simulation. We explore a Pupil-HOGD optimization algorithm for multi-angle illumination and validate it with a dual-angle holographic display prototype. Integrated with camera calibration and tracked eye position, the developed Pupil-HOGD algorithm can improve image quality and expand the eyebox by 50% in the horizontal direction. We envision the proposed approach paves the way for extending the space-bandwidth product (SBP) of holographic displays, enabling broader applications in immersive, high-quality visual computing environments.">

                      First row: Pupil centered at (0 mm, 0 mm). Dual illumination achieves clarity even at single-source spectrum edges.
                      Second row: Single illumination shows limited quality. Dual maintains fidelity within combined spectral range, expanding eyebox. (Dual-light configuration simplified in experiments.)

                              Holography has immense potential for near-eye displays in the realms of virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), offering natural 3D depth cues through wavefront reconstruction. However, a critical challenge is balancing the field of view (FOV) with the eyebox, fundamentally constrained by the étendue limitation of current hardware. Additionally, holographic image quality is often compromised due to discrepancies between actual wave propagation behavior and simulation models. This study addresses these challenges by expanding the eyebox through the use of multi-angle illumination, and by enhancing image quality with end-to-end pupil-aware hologram optimization. Further, energy efficiency is significantly improved by incorporating higher-order diffractions and pupil constraints into the simulation. We explore a Pupil-HOGD optimization algorithm for multi-angle illumination and validate it with a dual-angle holographic display prototype. Integrated with camera calibration and tracked eye position, the developed Pupil-HOGD algorithm can improve image quality and expand the eyebox by 50% in the horizontal direction. We envision the proposed approach paves the way for extending the space-bandwidth product (SBP) of holographic displays, enabling broader applications in immersive, high-quality visual computing environments.

                      We use a viewpoint spacing smaller than the pupil size to create a compact, continuous eyebox to ensure consistent, aligned holograms in near-eye displays. To address image aliasing introduced by the reduced spacing, a multi-angle illumination propagation framework is developed. This framework explicitly incorporates the dynamic pupil position and size to maintain consistent image quality across different viewpoints.

                          <b>Left</b>: Schematic of propagation under multi-angle light illumination. The SLM is illuminated by the superposition of plane waves incident from four distinct angles. Four light sources hit the SLM plane on P0, and to the target plane on P1, P2, P3, and P4. The parallel light waves, corresponding to their respective angles of inclination, superimpose at the same overlapping position on the target plane to reconstruct the image.
                          <b>Right</b>: Without algorithmic optimization, under horizontal dual-sources, the pupil position is moved along X, Y, and Z axes for simulations. When positioned at the origin, image overlap occurs. With X-axis pupil displacement, the result is similar to single-light-source imaging. Displacement along the Y-axis significantly degrades image quality due to a lack of vertical light source expansion. Z-axis displacement creates image overlap with arc-shaped artifacts due to aperture effects.

                      We conducted simulations to evaluate image quality under varying parameters, including different tilt angles and numbers of light sources.
                      High image quality is preserved with two distinct light source angles, which significantly enlarges the eyebox.
                      We built an experimental prototype using laser light sources from two distinct angles to validate proposed method.

The first column visualizes the pupil position in the frequency domain, while columns two to four display the results of the SGD, HOGD, and Pupil-HOGD algorithms, respectively. The fifth column showcases the optimized hologram using the Pupil-HOGD algorithm. The SGD algorithm yields the lowest PSNR due to neglecting higher-order diffraction. In contrast, the HOGD algorithm slightly improves but still ignores the pupil’s low-pass filtering effect. The Pupil-HOGD algorithm outperforms the others by accounting for the constraining effect of pupil position on light source utilization at various angles.
